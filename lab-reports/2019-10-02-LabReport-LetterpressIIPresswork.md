# Lab Report 4: Letterpress II: Presswork

#### Devon Regan

## Process Description

In this lab we finally got the chance to print the text we composited last week. A lot of the time was spent just waiting and watching, but when it was time to print my poem, Prof. Cordell lifted up the type I composited last week with a paradoxical balance of gentleness and equal force around the edges. He placed it in a wooden frame, filled the empty space with larger spacers, and fastened everything by twisting the fasteners at the sides with a little key/screwdriver to put enough pressure around the sides to keep everything in place.

The press itself was

## Observations

I had class in the Barrs Room during my very first semester as an English major at Northeastern, for a literary theory class with Kathleen Kelly. The door in the corner of the room was always just a silent part of a whole - like the backgrounds of cartoons, drawn with great detail since the animators didn't have to worry about changing them for each frame. But lo and behold! The fabled **Huskiana Press**, tucked into a tiny room with a bricked up fireplace along one wall. It smelled really weird in there - vaguely sulphuric but otherwise indistinguishable.

## Analysis

The final section of each report should bring your work in the lab into direct, critical conversation with our readings. In **_3-4 paragraphs_**, you should connect your lab observations to ideas from readings assigned _in the given lab unit_. This prose need not be as formal as a research paper, but it should demonstrate careful thought and preparation. You should integrate the readings explicitly, if possible through direct quotation. Use this writing to experiment with intellectual pairings you think might be generative to your larger thinking and help you prepare for the classâ€™ Unessay projects. Think of your lab reports as an evolving research paper, and take them as seriously as one.
