# Lab Report 7: Book Binding

#### Devon Regan

## Process Description

In this lab we finally put together the Twitterbot poetry chapbooks that have been in the works since practically the beginning of the semester. It consisted of two double-sided sheets of poetry and a yellow cardstock cover with questionably centered title graphics.

First, I folded each sheet of paper in half the hamburger way. I stacked them all together as they'd look in the finished book, then marked the stations with pencil at 1.25" intervals. Once it was my turn to use the cradle, I rested my chapbook against the solid bar at the top to line up all the pages. Using a subpar awl, I went in for what would be the spine at an angle before piercing holes in each of the stations I had marked earlier. Then, using a length of waxed string 2.5 times the vertical length of my chapbook, I threaded a needle that I wove through the stations as if I were sewing. I had to make sure I was weaving in and out of the pages at the right intervals, and that I was keeping the string taut for a neat binding, but by the time I tied the ends off at the center of the page I was left with a satisfying chapbook featuring poems ordered in a surprisingly intuitive way.

## Observations

I showed up to class late and shaky from a combination of caffeine and rushing to class, so I had to scramble to get myself together, which was stressful. But I didn't have too much trouble with the lab itself. Although the off-center title page was mildly infuriating, I love the way the chapbook came out if solely because of the *idea* of it. Finally! A finished product of the work we've done in this class for weeks. Delayed gratification. I love my classmates' poems. The source material is mostly indistinguishable from the finished result but they're all really pleasant to read. 

## Analysis

The final section of each report should bring your work in the lab into direct, critical conversation with our readings. In **_3-4 paragraphs_**, you should connect your lab observations to ideas from readings assigned _in the given lab unit_. This prose need not be as formal as a research paper, but it should demonstrate careful thought and preparation. You should integrate the readings explicitly, if possible through direct quotation. Use this writing to experiment with intellectual pairings you think might be generative to your larger thinking and help you prepare for the classâ€™ Unessay projects. Think of your lab reports as an evolving research paper, and take them as seriously as one.
