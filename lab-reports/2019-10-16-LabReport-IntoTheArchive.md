# Lab Report 6: Into The Archive

#### Devon Regan

## Process Description

This lab consisted of two parts. Part one was held in the Northeastern Archives & Special Collections, in the basement of Snell. Here, we looked at different examples of historical codices from the fabled Dragon Prayer Book to fancy 20th century book club reprints. We also got to take a look at an exciting collection of art books.

Part two brought us to the Massachusetts Historical Society. Here, we toured the first floor of a deceptively intricate building and learned how to access the research material they continually work to preserve. Their collections were more delicate, and they asked us not to touch them without prior "training", which you get before you can do hands-on research there.

## Observations

Who decides what gets put into an archive? It's a simple question with massive implications. And it's even bigger than choice alone - it's tied up in a matrix of social circumstance that becomes harder to pinpoint the more time stretches between then and now. Who *really* has the time and ability to keep a lifetime's worth of personal diaries besides the wealthy? Then again, the powerful people who have "made things happen" in history, so to speak, are worth remembering in the dimensions archived papers can offer. At least, the "things" that have been relayed to us in history classes.

Prof. Cordell brought up a great point towards the end of our time at the Mass. Historical Society: sometimes, you just have to read between the lines. Why *don't* we have records from "ordinary" people of the past? Well, most people may not have had the privilege of keeping diaries for fun but that doesn't mean they didn't interact with literature. He gave one example of a Boston merchant who kept extensive notes in the margins of newspapers, which we can now study for insight into myriad aspects of daily life.

It's easy to regard the past as something utterly disparate from now. But in fact, many patterns repeat themselves. To me, it's largely a matter of learning to look past the obvious differences that a 300 year old text contains, and read into the deeper implications.

I have a deep appreciation for when common things are intentionally changed to force us into new ways of thinking. This lab scratched my itch. You know how the greatest musicians are classically trained before putting their own spin on things, creating a style completely new and their own? I like that people are doing that with books now. Makes you think? What's next? Will everything just be deconstructed further and further until nothing means anything except in theory?

## Analysis

Who decides what gets put into an archive? After engaging in the lab activities and being opened up to the perspectives of people who are really passionate about this stuff, I have renewed appreciation for what the readings were saying.

Gleick's "Two Wordbooks" gave a history of the dictionary. Although we take for granted what "words" are "words", it went into depth about the role of the dictionary as prescriptive vs. descriptive, since its hazy inception. The two have always been in tense flux, it seems, though its initial purpose was to standardize spelling for the publishing industry.
