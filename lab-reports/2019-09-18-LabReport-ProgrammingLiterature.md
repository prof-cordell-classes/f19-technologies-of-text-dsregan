# Lab Report 2: Programming Literature

#### Devon Regan

## Process Description

In this lab we created simple word-substitution Twitter bots using Tracery, then implemented them using Cheap Bots Done Quick. I chose to base mine on a line of Sylvia Plath poetry that I stumbled across on Tumblr and really liked: "*Upholstered in red velvet, under the eye of uncaged tigers and a tropical moon..*" I picked out each word and listed a bunch of slight variations for the code to pull from, then strung these together using a variation of Markdown and voila! I set the tweets to be posted once daily under the digital moniker [@meltymp3](https://twitter.com/meltymp3).

## Observations

I love the poem I chose to work with for this lab. I spent probably 20 or 30 minutes poring over poetry I've collected independently, just in anticipation of this assignment. And yet - I hate almost every line of poetry I generated. Although they are all basically the same poem, the inexplicable magic of the original is lost once it's made into an algorithm. Adding too few words to my Tracery code made my poem too repetitive; yet adding too many diluted the image I was so captivated by in the first place. Although I can think of a lot of potential for **programming literature**, I don't think it can replace the human essence that makes poetry so wonderful. I feel like an old man jumping right into that argument, but maybe all it really means is that I should have chosen something funny instead of trying to make art with it.

It was also nice to, for once, be in a room where I am not the worst at coding - even if this is a dramatically simplified version. It was refreshing not to struggle with simple syntax issues that my peers kept getting stuck on. This is not me being smug, it's just an appreciation of my competence in light of the fact that most coding spaces make me feel like a capital-F Fool.

## Analysis

The final section of each report should bring your work in the lab into direct, critical conversation with our readings. In **_3-4 paragraphs_**, you should connect your lab observations to ideas from readings assigned _in the given lab unit_. This prose need not be as formal as a research paper, but it should demonstrate careful thought and preparation. You should integrate the readings explicitly, if possible through direct quotation. Use this writing to experiment with intellectual pairings you think might be generative to your larger thinking and help you prepare for the classâ€™ Unessay projects. Think of your lab reports as an evolving research paper, and take them as seriously as one.
