# Lab Report 3: Letterpress I: Composition

#### Devon Regan

## Process Description

In this lab I composited type to form a line of Twitter-bot poetry that I rendered last week using Tracery and based on a line from a Sylvia Plath poem. I opted for a standard, fairly large serif font because I like the way pretty words look in serif and I knew I wouldn't need too much space. Using a compositor stick tilted away from me at an angle, I nested each piece of type against itself or spacers, and had finished setting by the time the period ended.

## Observations

Last week I set my Twitterbot to post one new variation of a Sylvia Plath poem a day, but when I scrolled back through to find one I liked enough to put the time into compositing, I didn't particularly like any of them. So I ended up going back to Tracery (which I couldn't remember the name of) and generated a bunch of new variations until I found the one I wanted to put into print.

Working with lead type gave new meaning to the phrase "out of sorts" - literally. It's sort of a given (no pun intended) that many common phrases are rooted in real meaning, but this one was an especially nice surprise. The stress of running out of type that you need to complete a project is definitely a pertinent need.

Although Prof. Cordell made a point to disclaim that the lead type we were working with was not harmful, I could *swear* I felt the toxins leeching through my fingertips and into my bloodstream, flowing up the matrix of veins and arteries in my wrists > arms > shoulders > neck to poison my brain with publishing-themed delusions. This is a fear that's been programmed into me by the simple knowledge that lead = *bad*. But then again I've always been paranoid about that kind of stuff. (When I was little I touched a toad and made myself physically sick with worry that his warts were poisonous.) I'm sure real compositors of the day had bigger things on their mind.

## Analysis

The final section of each report should bring your work in the lab into direct, critical conversation with our readings. In **_3-4 paragraphs_**, you should connect your lab observations to ideas from readings assigned _in the given lab unit_. This prose need not be as formal as a research paper, but it should demonstrate careful thought and preparation. You should integrate the readings explicitly, if possible through direct quotation. Use this writing to experiment with intellectual pairings you think might be generative to your larger thinking and help you prepare for the classâ€™ Unessay projects. Think of your lab reports as an evolving research paper, and take them as seriously as one.
