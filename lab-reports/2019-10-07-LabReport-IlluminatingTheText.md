# Lab Report 5: Illuminating the Text

#### Devon Regan

## Process Description

Upon arriving to class, we were met with a closed door and the promise of a "guest" who we were waiting on. Then, by candlelight, we sat around the table *without* our stuff (fire hazard) and instructed to copy down a given photocopied letter by hand. Time was erased as we got to transcribing, with varying levels of difficulty according to the source material. I had Poe, who is apparently notorious for his good handwriting, but it was tiny script so I felt like I made no progress by the time we were told to stop. Sometime in the middle, the Fire Marshall stopped by! He opted to wait outside in case we had any issues. I can't *imagine* why he didn't want to sit down with us for what must have looked like a strange ritual.

## Observations

First of all, I was really surprised to find out that what I had interpreted as hoity-toity, almost petty writing / had devoted my full attention to transcribing, was by the notoriously spooky Edgar Allan Poe. I read his work extensively in a horror fiction course I took last spring, so that's my background on him. But I guess notions of authorship were really important to someone who took himself so seriously. He seems like a very dramatic dude - waiting *months* to reply because he was seething with too much rage. If he was writing it by candlelight in one sitting, and his hand was sweating as much as mine, I don't quite blame him.

I feel like it's probably much easier these days to be rash with your words, with the new immediacy of social media. Although Poe was exceptionally angry in his letter, he was more or less restrained in his language. He'd waited months to send it after all. By contrast, does having 24/7 access to public platforms (with one finger, even!) water down our connection to what we say? Nah, I guess. Not for *everything*. Papers still take a lot of time to write. We still sit down to compose and carefully reread important emails before they're sent. Tweets are a little different; maybe a new form of media entirely. It's a lot to think about in the age of Trump's presidency, where that's how he communicates with not only the American people but the world. These are immediate but somewhat impermanent, because they can be deleted. Makes for a bunch of mind-numbing nonsense that I can let suck hours out of my day if I'm not intentional about how I use it.

## Analysis

The final section of each report should bring your work in the lab into direct, critical conversation with our readings. In **_3-4 paragraphs_**, you should connect your lab observations to ideas from readings assigned _in the given lab unit_. This prose need not be as formal as a research paper, but it should demonstrate careful thought and preparation. You should integrate the readings explicitly, if possible through direct quotation. Use this writing to experiment with intellectual pairings you think might be generative to your larger thinking and help you prepare for the classâ€™ Unessay projects. Think of your lab reports as an evolving research paper, and take them as seriously as one.
