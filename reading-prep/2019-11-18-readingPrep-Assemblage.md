# Reading Prep: Assemblage

## Questions or Observations

1. I hope nobody ever uses the phrase "tour de force" to describe literature ever again. I hate it so. fucking. much. Find something new to say. No wonder everyone is disillusioned by literary convention.
2. Just last night I tweeted: *I have always chosen romanticized paths of existence as if I could read or listen to or watch or eat something that would propel me beyond organic cycles of discomfort wahhhhh escapism that doesn’t carry into the real world but also why I’m so literate*. It's as if the Pagan Kennedy reading was assigned this weekend for the cosmic purpose of exploring and conversing with this thought (particularly the Epilogue).
3. I don't like the phrase "erasure poetry." Maybe because the word 'erasure' has such negative connotations. To me it suggests that we are taking away something important rather than the (what I see as) intended purpose of finding hidden/unexpected meaning within larger texts.
