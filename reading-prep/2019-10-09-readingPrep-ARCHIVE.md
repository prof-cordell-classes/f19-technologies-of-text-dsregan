## Questions or Observations

1. Why is the distinction between *preservation* and *perseverance* so significant, with regard to not only Cherokee culture but more broadly?
2. The Mak reading details the significance of "cultural residue" (15) as part of a text's meaning but also as part of a larger "narrative about the social history of thought". Are we losing this as texts are abstracted to digital forms, or has this residue just changed form? Similarly, what is the irony of the PDF missing page 19?
3. While chugging through the Gleick reading, I couldn't push George Orwell's *1984* out of my mind. The situation he describes, where Newton struggled to define ideas that there were no words for yet, was sort of like a backwards version of the one Orwell posited - where words were condensed to their most basic forms and their opposites, i.e. "good and ungood" - in order to stifle free thought and ultimately opposition. This situation really emphasizes how much the language we have to work with limits our thought - something even a genius like Newton struggled with.
