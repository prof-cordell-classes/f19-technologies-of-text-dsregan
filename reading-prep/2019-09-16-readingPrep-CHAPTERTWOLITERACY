# Reading Prep 2: LITERACY

#### Devon Regan

### Questions or Observations

1. The chapter we read this weekend from Amaranth Borsuk's *The Book*, emphasized the book as a physical object and discussed at length how myriad **developments in writing** changed how knowledge was shared. Which did you find most interesting and why? How do these developments reflect or ultimately shape the cultures that created them?
2. How does the monk Ã†lfric's view of written translation **differ** from Socrates' fears about the dangers of written language? How are their views on writing **similar**?
3. It's interesting that we've spent so much time so far talking about the book as an *object* indistinguishable from the ideas they convey. But reading Butler's short story, watered down into a bare-bones Times New Roman PDF, made a point to emphasize the ideas of the story. Noticing this intentionality is becoming second nature to me.
